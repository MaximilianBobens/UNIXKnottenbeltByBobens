       <li>An operating system (OS) is a resource manager.</li>  <br>
       <li>Ensures safe access to resources like printers, managing CPU efficiently by suspending waiting programs for I/O operations, and providing abstractions like files instead of disk locations.</li><br>

<div class="section">
    <h2>1.3 Architecture of the Linux Operating System </h2>
    <p class="lead">
    <h4>Kernel</h4>
        The Linux kernel includes device driver support for a large number of PC hardware devices (graphics cards, network cards, hard disks etc.), advanced processor and memory management features, and support for many different types of filesystems (including DOS floppies and the ISO9660 standard for CDROMs). In terms of the services that it provides to application programs and system utilities, the kernel implements most BSD and SYSV system calls, as well as the system calls described in the POSIX.1 specification.
        The kernel (in raw binary form that is loaded directly into memory at system startup time) is typically found in the file
    /boot/vmlinuz, while the source files can usually be found in /usr/src/linux.The latest version of the Linux kernel sources
    can be downloaded from.

    <h4>Shells and GUIs</h4>
        Linux supports two forms of command input: through textual command line shells similar to those found
    on most UNIX systems (e.g. sh - the Bourne shell, bash - the Bourne again shell and csh - the C shell) and through graphical
    interfaces (GUIs) such as the KDE and GNOME window managers. If you are connecting remotely to a server your access will typically
    be through a command line shell.

    <h4>System Utilities</h4>
        Virtually every system utility that you would expect to find on standard implementations of UNIX (including every system utility described in the POSIX.2 specification) has been ported to Linux. This includes commands such as ls, cp, grep, awk, sed, bc, wc, more, and so on. These system utilities are designed to be powerful tools that do a single task extremely well (e.g. grep finds text inside files while wc counts the number of words, lines and bytes inside a file). Users can often solve problems by interconnecting these tools instead of writing a large monolithic application program.
        Like other UNIX flavours, Linux's system utilities also include server programs called daemons which provide
    remote network and administration services (e.g. telnetd and sshd provide remote login facilities, lpd provides printing
    services , httpd serves web pages, crond runs regular system administration tasks automatically).
    A daemon (probably derived from the Latin word which refers to a beneficient spirit who watches over someone,
    or perhaps short for "Disk And Execution MONitor") is usually spawned automatically at system startup and spends
    most of its time lying dormant (lurking?) waiting for some event to occur.

    <h4>Application programs</h4>
        Linux distributions typically come with several useful application programs as standard. Examples include the emacs editor, xv (an image viewer), gcc (a C compiler), g++ (a C++ compiler), xfig (a drawing package), latex (a powerful typesetting language) and soffice (StarOffice, which is an MS-Office style clone that can read and write Word, Excel and PowerPoint files).
        Redhat Linux also comes with rpm, the Redhat Package Manager which makes it easy to install and uninstall application programs.

                    One of the things you should do when you log in for the first time is to change your password.
                    The UNIX command to change your password is passwd:

                <strong>$ passwd</strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                The system will prompt you for your old password, then for your new password.
                To eliminate any possible typing errors you have made in your new password, it will ask you to reconfirm your new password.
                Remember the following points when choosing your password:
                Avoid characters which might not appear on all keyboards, e.g. '£'.
                The weakest link in most computer security is user passwords so keep your password a secret, don't write it down and don't tell it to anyone else. Also avoid dictionary words or words related to your personal details (e.g. your boyfriend or girlfriend's name or your login).
                Make it at least 7 or 8 characters long and try to use a mix of letters, numbers and punctuation.

        <p>The UNIX operating system is built around the concept of a filesystem which is used to store all of the information that constitutes the long-term state of the system. This state includes the operating system kernel itself, the executable files for the commands supported by the operating system, configuration information, temporary workfiles, user data, and various special files that are used to give controlled access to system hardware and operating system functions.
            Every item stored in a UNIX filesystem belongs to one of four types:</p>

                            <p>ls lists the contents of a directory. If no target directory is given, then the contents of the current working directory are displayed. So, if the current working directory is /,</p>

                            <p>Actually, ls doesn't show you all the entries in a directory - files and directories that begin with a dot (.) are hidden (this includes the directories '.' and '..' which are always present). The reason for this is that files that begin with a . usually contain important configuration information and should not be changed under normal circumstances. If you want to see all files, ls supports the -a option:</p>
                            <pre><code>
                            <strong>$ ls -a</strong>

                            <p>Even this listing is not that helpful - there are no hints to properties such as the size, type and ownership of files, just their names. To see more detailed information, use the -l option (long listing), which can be combined with the -a option as follows:</p>
                            <pre><code>
                            <strong> $ ls -a -l</strong>

                                <p>cp is used to make copies of files or entire directories. To copy files, use:</p>
                                <strong>$ cp source-file(s) destination</strong>
                                <p>where source-file(s) and destination specify the source and destination of the copy respectively. The behaviour of cp depends on whether the destination is a file or a directory. If the destination is a file, only one source file is allowed and cp makes a new file called destination that has the same contents as the source file. If the destination is a directory, many source files can be specified, each of which will be copied into the destination directory. Section 2.6 will discuss efficient specification of source files using wildcard characters.

                                    To copy entire directories (including their contents), use a recursive copy:</p>
                                <strong>$ cp -rd source-directories destination-directory</strong>
                            </div>

                                <p>mv is used to rename files/directories and/or move them from one directory into another. Exactly one source and one destination must be specified:</p>
                                <strong>$ mv source destination</strong>
                                <p>If destination is an existing directory, the new name for source (whether it be a file or a directory) will  be destination/source. If source and destination are both files, source is renamed destination. N.B.: if destination is an existing file it will be destroyed and overwritten by source (you can use the -i option if you would like to be asked for confirmation before a file is overwritten in this way).

                                <p>removes the specified files. Unlike other operating systems, it is almost impossible to recover a deleted file unless you have a backup (there is no recycle bin!) so use this command with care. If you would like to be asked before files are deleted, use the -i option:</p>
                                <strong>$ rm -i myfile
                                    rm: remove 'myfile'?</strong>
                                <p>rm can also be used to delete directories (along with all of their contents, including any subdirectories they contain). To do this, use the -r option. To avoid rm from asking any questions or giving errors (e.g. if the file doesn't exist) you used the -f (force) option. Extreme care needs to be taken when using this option - consider what would happen if a system administrator was trying to delete user will's home directory and accidentally typed:</p>
                                <strong>$ rm -rf / home/will</strong>
